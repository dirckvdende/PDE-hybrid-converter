# Domain grid

Contains classes that assist in determining the domain that is given in the input and converting it to a grid. The `domain.h` file contains a class to determine all of the cells that make up a domain. This class can then produce a "domain grid". The `domaingrid.h` file contains a class for this domain grid. The domain grid is an actual grid that contains information about each cell: Is it in the domain, on the boundary, etc.?
