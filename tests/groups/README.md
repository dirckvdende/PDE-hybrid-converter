# Grouping algorithm tests

This folder contains several tests for grid grouping algorithms. One for testing performance of the different algorithms (proportion of border cells), one for timing the algorithms, one for bulk testing and one for visual output. The visual output program executes the `graphic.py` script automatically, and needs to be executed from the project main folder.
